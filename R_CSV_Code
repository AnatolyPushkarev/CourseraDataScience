my_Funk <- function(x) {
# I am initialising function my_Funk that takes on one argument x

  setwd("my_data")
# I am setting working directory to my_data
  
  temp <- list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
# I store the list of the *.csv files in the vector temp
  
  for (i in x) assign(temp[i], read.csv(temp[i]))  
# I read only specified portion of the *.csv files into the R environment
# The portion defined by the vector x
  
}

# When I upload the function into the global environment
# And then call it with my_Funk(1:5) - Nothing happens
# And I also don't see any temp variables or and csv files

# If I execute the part of my function one by one it works perfectly fine
# But, it doesn't work as a whole

# Can you please tell me what is wrong with the function?
